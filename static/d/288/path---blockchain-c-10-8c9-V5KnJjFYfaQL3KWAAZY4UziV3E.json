As opposed to a centrally located server IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ipfs.io/\">https://ipfs.io/</a></p>\n<h2>Dilemma dei generali bizantini</h2>\n<h3>Solidity of Etherurem VM in the browser IDE</h3>\n<p>Remix - Solidity IDE: <a href=\"https://remix.ethereum.org/\">https://remix.ethereum.org/</a></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on Blockchain & Web 3.0 Stack","date":"May 06, 2019","description":"Some random notes upon blockchain"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"slug":"/blockchain/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/random-notes-on-ml/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Notes on Machine Learing"}},"next":null}}
